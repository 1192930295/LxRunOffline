```
LxRunOffline install <name> <path to .tar.gz> <target installation directory>
```

The last three options are for the [WSL_DISTRIBUTION_FLAGS](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/mt826872(v=vs.85).aspx). They should be integers and zero(0) means enabled while non-zero means disabled.
